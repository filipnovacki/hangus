# hangus
A little hangman game, a little study of python

This is a little study of Python that came after reading about object-oriented 
`Python`. This project contains a lot of technical elements because of its 
studying purpose.

## Features
* Object oriented design
  * SOLID principles
  * Properties
  * Simplicity
* Unit test
* Architecture with separated logic and display
* Code documentation
* Fool proof (invalid entries and other misuse is not allowed and will not 
crash application)

## How it actually works?

So far it has not yet been developed as a console application so the user should
run the `main.py` file using `python3`.

When started, the application leads the user through the game. It is designed 
for two players. One should first enter the word or a phrase. After 
that the second player should guess the word or a phrase, and the first player
may or may not laugh at the second player. 

It is still far from perfect, it requires a little polish, but the basis 
is made.
