# hangus
A little hangman game, that's actually fun to play

This is a little study of Python that came after years of using it.
This project contains no bullshit.

## Features
  - ACTUAL Simplicity
	- ACTUALLY Fun

## How it actually works?

So far it has not yet been developed as a console application so the user should
run the `hangman.py` file using `python2`.

```
> python2 hangman.py
```

When started, the application leads the user through the game. It is designed
for one player. The word is randomly selected through some wild api. After
that the player should guess the word or a phrase.

It is now perfect, it requires no polish.
